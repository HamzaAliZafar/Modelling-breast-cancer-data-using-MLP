Predicting whether the cancer is malignant or benign from the features in the dataset. Information about the dataset can be found at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Original%29

Note that the data has 10 attributes and one class variable. The goal is to predict whether the cancer is malignant or benign from the features, which have been extracted from mammogram images. The first column is a unique code number, which is not useful for prediction and should not be used as input to your classifier. The last one is the class to predict (2 means benign and 4 means malignant). Here are the fields:

Names = ['code', 'clump-thickness', 'cell-size', 'cell-shape', 'marginal-adhesion','single-epithelial', 'bare-nuclei', 'bland-chromatin', 'normal-nucleoli', 'mitosis', 'Class']
